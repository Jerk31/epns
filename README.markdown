ePNS
====
__ePNS__ aims to create an easy way to visualize and interact with a simulation for a continuous dynamic system (for example, a railway system). The dynamic system will be modeled by a Petri net. To allow the modeling of continuous systems, the classical concepts of Petri nets are extended so that the new version can model more than discrete systems.

The purpose of __ePNS__ is to facilitate track based simulations of Petri nets. A track based simulation is understood as a simulation of a world, where objects move along tracks, following a set of rules given by the Petri net. The objects can be simulated as trains on tracks, cars on roads, or any other object following a predefined route.

Usage
-----
The product is developed as a plugin for Eclipse. For development, the projects in the __src__ folder have to be imported in Eclipse and a new runtime Eclipse Workbench should be started. Other requirements for properly running the plugin are described in the Installation section of the Handbook.

The repository also contains five examples, present in the __examples__ folder. They can be all imported as a project in the Eclipse Workbench where the plugin has been loaded.

For more details, please see the __System Specification__ and __Handbook__ files in the root of the repository.
