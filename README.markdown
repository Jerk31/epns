ePNS
====
__ePNS__ aims to create an easy way to visualize and interact with a simulation for a continuous dynamic system (for example, a railway system). The dynamic system will be modeled by a Petri net. To allow the modeling of continuous systems, the classical concepts of Petri nets are extended so that the new version can model more than discrete systems.

The purpose of __ePNS__ is to facilitate track based simulations of Petri nets. A track based simulation is understood as a simulation of a world, where objects move along tracks, following a set of rules given by the Petri net. The objects can be simulated as trains on tracks, cars on roads, or any other object following a predefined route.
